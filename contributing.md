# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, discord or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Issues and feature requests

All issues are for you to contribute to. Make sure to declare that you are taking up on an issue so that other developers can work on something else, ensuring efforts are not being doubly spent on a same issue.

### Creating an issue

You've found a bug in the source code or maybe you'd like a new feature? You can help us by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/starknet-id/starknet.quest/issues). Before you create an issue, make sure to search the issue archive -- your issue may have already been addressed!

Please try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what
  environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
- _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

**Even better: Submit a pull request with a fix or new feature!**
